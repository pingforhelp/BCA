C is a **programming language** developed at AT&T (Bell Labs US) in **1972**.  
It was designed and written by Dennis Ritchie.  

In the late **1970s**, C began to replace the more **famous programming languages** of that time like **BCPL** and **Assembly**.  

**ANSI C** (American National Standards Institute C) was standardized in the **1980s**.  
The original *K&R C* book (“The C Programming Language” by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie) was split into **two editions** — the **first edition** (1978, pre-ANSI C) and the **second edition** (1988, updated for ANSI C).

C is popular **because** it is easy to use, simple, and reliable.

- **Low-level languages** are closer to machine language. Examples:
  - **Machine language**: The CPU only understands binary code (`0`s and `1`s).  
    Commands given to the CPU are in the form of **binary instructions**.  
  - **Assembly language**: A step above machine code, using mnemonics instead of binary.

- **High-level languages** (like C, Java, Python) are closer to human language and easier to learn and use.


# Unit 1. Introduction to computer programming

Introduction: Computer Programming is the process of designing and writing a sequence of instructions（a program) that tells a computer how to perform tasks. A program translates human logic into a form that hardware can execute.
Think of it likewriting a recipe for a computer. The recipe is the program, the ingredients are the data, and the steps are the instructions. The person who writes these instructions is called a programmer, and they write them in a special language called a programming
language.The entire set of instructions written in a programming language is called source
code.

programming matters:
- Automates tasks, performs computations fast.
- Builds software systems (apps, OS, games, web services).
- Bridges problem-solving (algorithmic thinking) and machine execution.
Types of software
Software is a collection of programs and data that tells a computer what to do. 

It is broadly
divided into two main categories:

1. System Software: This software acts as an intermediary between the computer hardware and the user's applications. Its main purpose is to manage the computer's
resources. Examples:
- Operating Systems (OS): Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android. They manage all
other software and hardware on the computer.
- Device Drivers: Software that allows the OS to communicate with hardware
devices like printers,keyboards,and webcams.
- Utilities: Programs designed for system maintenance, like antivirus software or disk cleanup tools.

2. Application Software: This software is designed to perform specific tasks for the end-user. It runs on top of the system software.

Examples:
- Web Browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox.
- Word Processors: Microsoft Word, Google Docs.
- Games: Fortnite, Minecraft, CSGO,.

Media Players: VLC Media Player, MPCL.

Types Of Software:
1. System Application
Software.
2. Operating System.
3. Language processor.
General purpose.
4. Customised Software
and device drivers:
- linux,
- Interpreter,
- Ms-word
- Railways reservation
- Windows.
- Compiler.
- Photshop.
- System.

# Compiler and interpreter

Computers only understand machine code (binary O’s and 1’s). Since we write programs in high-level languages (like C or Python), they need to be translated.

Compilers and interpreters are two types of translator programs that do this job.
