C is a **programming language** developed at AT&T (Bell Labs US) in **1972**.  
It was designed and written by Dennis Ritchie.  

In the late **1970s**, C began to replace the more **famous programming languages** of that time like **BCPL** and **Assembly**.  

**ANSI C** (American National Standards Institute C) was standardized in the **1980s**.  
The original *K&R C* book (“The C Programming Language” by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie) was split into **two editions** — the **first edition** (1978, pre-ANSI C) and the **second edition** (1988, updated for ANSI C).

C is popular **because** it is easy to use, simple, and reliable.

- **Low-level languages** are closer to machine language. Examples:
  - **Machine language**: The CPU only understands binary code (`0`s and `1`s).  
    Commands given to the CPU are in the form of **binary instructions**.  
  - **Assembly language**: A step above machine code, using mnemonics instead of binary.

- **High-level languages** (like C, Java, Python) are closer to human language and easier to learn and use.
