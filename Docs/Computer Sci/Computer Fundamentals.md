A computer is an **electronic** machine designed to take input, process it, and display output as **pre-defined instructions**.

Hardware i.e., the physical **components** and software are the programming.
The computer operates on IPO (Input, Processing, Output).

* **Input**: Data is fed in the computer via input devices such as a mouse or keyboard.

* **Processing**: The data is processed by **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** according to instructions.

* **Output**: The processed information (data) is delivered via output devices like a **monitor** and printer.

* A computer can store data using **primary memory (RAM)** for temporary use or **secondary memory** for long storage.

* **RAM** refers to Random Access Memory.

* **ROM** refers to Read Only Memory. It **cannot** change files in the computer; it only stores instructions that can be read, not written, by a user.

**Characteristics of computer:**
* **Speed** – A computer can process **billions of instructions** per second. Modern processors have speed measured in **GHz**, meaning they can handle **billions of cycles** per second.
* **Accuracy** – Computers follow instructions and produce all results without errors, except for bugs or human error.
* **Automation** – Once programmed, a computer operates automatically.
* **Storage** – Computers store vast amounts of data in primary memory.
* **Versatility** – A simple computer can perform many tasks such as playing a movie or editing a document.
* **Diligence** – A computer can perform repetitive tasks without pause.
* **Cost-effectiveness** – The automation and speed of computers reduce the time and manpower required to complete tasks.
