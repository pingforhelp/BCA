# 1.1 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad and rapidly evolving field of computer science focused on designing and building machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include:

- **Learning** – the ability to improve performance based on experience (e.g., machine learning algorithms that learn from data)
- **Problem-solving** – finding solutions to complex problems (e.g., optimizing routes, solving puzzles)
- **Decision-making** – making choices under uncertainty (e.g., medical diagnosis systems)
- **Perception** – interpreting sensory data like images, sounds, or videos (e.g., facial recognition)
- **Language understanding** – processing and generating human language (e.g., chatbots, translation tools)

AI systems aim to replicate or simulate human cognitive functions using algorithms, statistical models, and data-driven approaches.

# Types of AI
1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)** – Designed for a specific task (e.g., voice assistants, recommendation systems).  
2. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)** – Designed for a specific task (e.g., voice assistants, recommendation systems).  
3. **Super AI** – Hypothetical systems that surpass human intelligence across all domains.

### AI Techniques

- **Machine Learning** – Systems that learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
- **Deep Learning** – A subset of machine learning using neural networks with many layers.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Enabling machines to understand and generate human language.
- **Computer Vision** – Allowing machines to interpret visual information.

# 1.2 History of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The history of Artificial Intelligence spans several decades of research, innovation, and milestones. Here’s a structured overview from its early ideas to present-day advancements:

1. Early Ideas (Pre–20th Century)
- The concept of intelligent machines can be traced back to ancient myths, stories, and automata.
- Greek myths about mechanical beings and medieval thinkers like **Aristotle** explored logic and reasoning, laying philosophical foundations.
- In the 17th century, **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** worked on symbolic logic, which influenced later computational theories.
2. Birth of AI (1940s–1950s)
- **Alan Turing (1950):** Introduced the *Turing Test* to assess whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human.
- **John von Neumann:** His work on stored-program computers provided the architecture for computational processes.
- **1956 – Dartmouth Conference:** Considered the official birth of AI as a field. Researchers like John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Herbert Simon, and Allen Newell gathered to explore machine intelligence.
3. Early AI Programs (1950s–1970s)
- **Logic Theorist (1956):** Created by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon; it could prove mathematical theorems.
- **General Problem Solver (1957):** Another early AI program capable of solving puzzles.
- **ELIZA (1966):** An early chatbot by Joseph Weizenbaum that simulated conversation.
4. The First AI Winter (1970s–1980s)
- Progress slowed due to limitations in computing power and unrealistic expectations.
- Funding and interest declined because early systems couldn't handle real-world complexities.
- AI research faced skepticism, and this period became known as the *AI Winter*.
5. Expert Systems Era (1980s)
- AI revived with **Expert Systems**, programs that used a set of rules to solve specific problems.
- **Example: MYCIN** – A medical diagnosis system.
- Governments and industries invested heavily, but these systems were expensive and hard to maintain.
- The field again faced challenges, leading to a second AI Winter in the late 1980s.
6. Machine Learning and Big Data (1990s–2000s)
- Researchers shifted focus from rule-based systems to **machine learning**, where systems learn from data.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**, decision trees, and other algorithms gained popularity.
- With improved computing power and access to large datasets, AI systems became more practical.
- AI started being used in areas like speech recognition and recommendation systems.
7. Deep Learning and Modern AI (2010s–Present)
- Deep learning using neural networks revolutionized AI.
- Image recognition, natural language processing, and self-driving cars became achievable.
- **Landmark achievements:**
  - **AlphaGo (2016):** Defeated human champions in the game of Go.
  - **GPT models (2018 onward):** Large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 that understand and generate human-like text.

AI is now widely used in healthcare, finance, education, entertainment, and more.
