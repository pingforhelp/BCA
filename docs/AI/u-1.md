# Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to a type of machine intelligence that can perform any intellectual task that a human being is capable of. It is also known as **strong AI** or **full AI**.

Current AI systems are limited to specific functions, whereas AGI aims to replicate human cognitive abilities such as:
- Reasoning  
- Problem-solving  
- Learning from experience  
- Understanding language, context, and emotions  
- Adapting to new situations  

AGI systems are designed to apply knowledge across different domains without needing specialized programming. They can transfer skills, learn from new experiences, and improve themselves over time, much like humans do.

Key Features of AGI:
1. **Broad Abilities:** Able to perform diverse tasks without needing separate training for each.  
2. **Learning and Adaptation:** Learns from experience and applies it to unfamiliar situations.  
3. **Human-like Understanding:** Interprets language, context, and behavior intelligently.  
4. **Transferability:** Applies knowledge across various domains and tasks.  
5. **Self-improvement:** Enhances its own capabilities without external intervention.

Why is AGI Important?
AGI represents the next frontier in artificial intelligence. It has the potential to revolutionize technology and society by creating machines that think, reason, and learn like humans. However, developing AGI is a major challenge due to its complexity and ethical considerations.

# Knowledge Engineering
Knowledge Engineering is a branch of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Computer Science** dedicated to the design, development, and maintenance of knowledge-based systems. Its primary objective is to capture, represent, organize, and utilize human expertise and domain-specific knowledge in a machine-readable form. This structured knowledge enables intelligent systems to reason, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems within specialized domain.

 Steps in Knowledge Engineering
1. **Knowledge Acquisition** – The process of gathering expertise from domain specialists and converting it into a form understandable by computers. Techniques include expert interviews, surveys, observations, and analysis of existing documents or case studies.
2. **Knowledge Representation** – Organizing and structuring acquired knowledge in a machine-interpretable format. Ontologies, semantic networks, rules, frames, and logic-based models are common representation methods.
3. **Knowledge Integration** – Combining knowledge from different sources such as structured databases, unstructured text, and expert rules into a unified knowledge base.
4. **Inference and Reasoning** – Developing algorithms and mechanisms that allow the system to draw conclusions, make inferences, and apply logical reasoning.
5. **Maintenance and Refinement** – Continuously updating and improving the knowledge base to keep pace with domain changes. This ensures accuracy, relevance, and adaptability of the system over time.
6. **Verification and Validation** Checking that knowledge has been correctly captured and represented. Ensuring that the system’s results are consistent with real-world expectations and expert judgment.
7. **Deployment and Interaction** Integrating the knowledge-based system into real-world applications. Designing user-friendly interfaces that allow users to query the system and receive accurate, meaningful responses.

# Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to automatically learn from data and enhance their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed. In other words, ML systems identify patterns in data and use them to make predictions or decisions.

Here’s Tom Mitchell’s widely cited definition of Machine Learning:
“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”

omponents:
- **T = Task** (what the program is supposed to do)  
- **P = Performance measure** (how we evaluate the model)  
- **E = Experience** (data or feedback used for learning)

> [!example]
- Task (T) = Playing chess  
- Performance (P) = Win rate against opponents  
- Experience (E) = Games played.


Types of Machine Learning
The following table represents the different types of machine learning and its applications.
