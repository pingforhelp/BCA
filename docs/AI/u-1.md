# 1.1 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad and rapidly evolving field of computer science focused on designing and building machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

These tasks include:
* **Learning** – improving performance based on experience (e.g., machine learning algorithms)
* **Problem-solving** – finding solutions to complex problems (e.g., route optimization)
* **Decision-making** – making choices under uncertainty (e.g., medical diagnosis)
* **Perception** – interpreting sensory data (images, sound, video)
* **Language Understanding** – processing and generating human language (e.g., chatbots, translators)

> **AIM:** AI systems aim to replicate or simulate human cognitive functions using algorithms, statistical models, and data-driven approaches.

# Types of AI

1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)** – Designed for specific tasks (voice assistants, chatbots, recommendation systems).
2. **General AI (Strong AI)** – Aims to perform *any* intellectual task a human can (theoretical).
3. **Super AI** – Hypothetical AI surpassing human intelligence across all domains

# History of AI
The history of AI spans several decades of research, innovation, and milestones.

# 1. Early Ideas (Pre-20th Century)
- Ancient myths, automata
- Aristotle’s logic and reasoning
- Leibniz’s symbolic logic, influencing computation.

# 2. Birth of AI (1940s–1950s)
* **Alan Turing (1950):** Turing Test
* **John von Neumann:** Stored-program computer architecture
* **Dartmouth Conference (1956):** Birth of AI as a field

# 3. Logic Theorists (1956)
Created by Newell & Simon to prove mathematical theorems.
* **General Problem Solver (1957)**
* **ELIZA (1966)** – First chatbot

# AI Techniques
-  **Machine Learning (ML)** – Learning from data
* **Deep Learning** – Neural networks with many layers
* **NLP** – Understanding & generating language
* **Computer Vision** – Interpreting visual information
  
```
\text{Data} \rightarrow \text{Model} \rightarrow \text{Prediction}
```
* Optimism was high; researchers believed human-level AI was close.

# 4. The First AI Winter (1970s–1980s)
* Limited computing power
* Unrealistic expectations
* Funding cuts
* Heavy skepticism

  

# 5. Expert Systems Era (1980s)
* AI revived by rule-based expert systems
* **Example:** MYCIN (medical diagnosis)
* Expensive to maintain → **Second AI Winter (late 1980s)**

# 6. Machine Learning and Big Data (1990s–2000s)
* Shift from rule-based to statistical learning
* SVMs, decision trees, probabilistic models
* Large datasets improved performance
* Used in speech recognition, recommendation systems

# 7. Deep Learning and Modern AI (2010s–Present)
* Neural networks revolutionize AI
* Breakthroughs in image recognition, NLP, self-driving cars

#  Landmark achievements:
* **AlphaGo (2016)** – defeated world Go champion
* **GPT-3, GPT-4 (2018→)** – human-like text generation Used in healthcare, finance, education, entertainment, etc.

# 4. Current Trends and Future Outlook

# 1.3 Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
AGI refers to machine intelligence capable of performing *any* intellectual task a human can do.
AGI aims to replicate:
- Reasoning
- Problem-solving
- Learning from experience
- Understanding language, emotion, context
- Adapting to new situations

AGI transfers knowledge across domains and improves itself over time.

# Key Features of AGI
1. **Broad Abilities** – Multiple tasks, no retraining needed
2. **Learning & Adaptation** – Learns from experience
3. **Human-like Understanding** – Contextual, behavioral understanding
4. **Transferability** – Knowledge across domains
5. **Self-improvement** – Autonomous upgrading.

# Why is AGI Important?
AGI could revolutionize society but also poseshical and technical challenges.
