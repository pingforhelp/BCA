Mid-2 (AI) – Imp Questions  
Unit: 3, 4, 5.  

Short Answers – Each 5M 

# Q1. Define bias in AI. Explain the types of bias in AI. 
Ans: Bias in AI refers to unfair, prejudiced, or discriminatory outcomes generated by Al systems due to flawed datasets, biased algorithms, or human-driven design choices. Ensuring fairness is critical for equitable AI deployment. 

Types of Bias in Al:
1. Confirmation Bias.
2. Algorithmic Bias.
3. Sampling Bias.
4. Generative Bias.
5. Group Attribution Bias.

Q2. Discuss security & privacy challenges in AI systems.
Ans: AI systems relies heavily on extensive data collection and complex algorithms, creating new and significant challenges to security and privacy.

Security Challenges in Al Systems:
1. Data Poisoning and Adversarial Attacks:
2. Al-Powered Cyberattacks
3. Insecure Data Handling.
4. Model Theft

# Q3. Principles of ethical AI.
Ans:  Ethical Principles:

Fairness and Non-Discrimination: AI systems must avoid biases that lead to unfair treatment across race, gender, and socioeconomic groups. Ensuring fairness allows diversified datasets and diverse training data to contribute to accurate results and decisions.

Accountability and Responsibility: Citizens and stakeholders bear Responsibility and outcomes by Measuing the AI behaviours. This avoids impact assessment into the system accountability.

Transparency and Explainability: AI models should provide transparency, explaining key decisions, accessing the values through Explainability will help users, empowers developers in avoiding the harmful biases in models.

Privacy and Data Protection: Respecting personal data collection, storage, and sharing practices are critical to avoid misuse. AI developers should adopt privacy-preserving techniques and regulatory guidelines for data usage and privacy.

Human Agency and Oversight: Human control over AI decisions should be maintained. Humans need appropriate intervention rights, especially in high-risk domains, upholding dignity and preventing unchecked autonomous decision-making.
# Q4. What are prompts?
Ans: An AI prompt is a question, command or statement that a person gives to a model, such as a LLM, to guide it in generating a specific response or output.
  
Q5. Define the transparency in AI systems. Explain its importance.  
Principles of ethical, applications, limitations & future directions.  

# Q2. Explain the applications of AI in experimentation & research.
