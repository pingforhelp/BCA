Mid-2 AI – Imp Questions  
Unit: 3, 4, 5.  

Short Answers. Each ++5 marks++ 

# Q1. Define bias in AI. Explain the types of bias in AI. 
Ans: Bias in AI refers to unfair, prejudiced, or discriminatory outcomes generated by Al systems due to flawed datasets, biased algorithms, or human-driven design choices. Ensuring fairness is critical for equitable AI deployment. 

Types of Bias in Al:
1. Confirmation Bias.
2. Algorithmic Bias.
3. Sampling Bias.
4. Generative Bias.
5. Group Attribution Bias.

Q2. Discuss security & privacy challenges in AI systems.
Ans: AI systems relies heavily on extensive data collection and complex algorithms, creating new and significant challenges to security and privacy.

Security Challenges in Al Systems:
1. Data Poisoning and Adversarial Attacks:
2. Al-Powered Cyberattacks
3. Insecure Data Handling.
4. Model Theft

# Q3. Principles of ethical AI.
Ans:  Ethical Principles:

Fairness and Non-Discrimination: AI systems must avoid biases that lead to unfair treatment across race, gender, and socioeconomic groups. Ensuring fairness allows diversified datasets and diverse training data to contribute to accurate results and decisions.

Accountability and Responsibility: Citizens and stakeholders bear Responsibility and outcomes by Measuing the AI behaviours. This avoids impact assessment into the system accountability.

Transparency and Explainability: AI models should provide transparency, explaining key decisions, accessing the values through Explainability will help users, empowers developers in avoiding the harmful biases in models.

Privacy and Data Protection: Respecting personal data collection, storage, and sharing practices are critical to avoid misuse. AI developers should adopt privacy-preserving techniques and regulatory guidelines for data usage and privacy.

Human Agency and Oversight: Human control over AI decisions should be maintained. Humans need appropriate intervention rights, especially in high-risk domains, upholding dignity and preventing unchecked autonomous decision-making.

# Q4. What are prompts?
Ans: An AI prompt is a question, command or statement that a person gives to a model, such as a LLM, to guide it in generating a specific response or output.
  
Q5. Define the transparency in AI systems. Explain its importance.  
Principles of ethical, applications, limitations & future directions.  
Ans: same answer.

# Q1. Define ChatGPT and explain it's features, working, applications, limitations, and future advancements.
Ans: Chat GPT stands for ==Generative Pre-trained Transformer==. It is a chat bot, LLM Large Language Models,Generative AI. Aimed to act/think/reason more like or better so than Humans.

Features of GPT
- Memory it remebers your convocations key words, in them.
- Computer vision / OCR You can covert handwritten documents into whatever you want format you want. It is better than a normal OCR because it can fix the mistakes by generating the missing words.

Working of GPT:
1. Input from the user
2. Packing of said Input.
3. Sending it to Open AI’s server it logs and then sends it goes to.
4. Data centres where the input (prompt) is processed.
5. The model then looks up for answers in it's training data and applying 


# Q2. Explain the applications of AI in experimentation & research.
Ans: AI improves research by making it more accurate, faster, and more efficient. Automated Data Analysis: AI can quickly analyze large and complex datasets to find patterns or trends that a human might miss. For example, an AI model can analyze thousands of genomic sequences to find potential disease markers.
