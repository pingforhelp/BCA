used vacuum tubes as the main electronic response for processing data.</p><ul><li>The first generations were from 1942–1955.</li><li>These computers were physically large and required huge rooms.</li><li>Used magnetic drums for memory storage.</li><li>Used punched cards and paper tapes for input/output.<br> Disadvantages:</li><li>They consumed more power.</li><li>These computers were large in size.</li><li>These computers produced a large amount of heat.</li><li>They had limited commercial use.</li></ul><p>The <strong>second generation</strong> computers were manufactured in the years 1955–1964.</p><ul><li>These computers used transistors in place of vacuum tubes.</li><li>They were smaller in size and required less space for installation.</li><li>They used magnetic tapes as secondary storage devices.</li><li>They consumed less power and produced less amount of heat.</li><li>They were about 10 times faster than first generation computers.</li><li>They were more reliable.</li><li>Less prone to hardware failure compared to the first generation.</li></ul><p>The <strong>third generation</strong> computers were manufactured in the years 1964–1975.</p><ul><li>These computers used integrated circuits (ICs) instead of vacuum tubes and transistors.</li><li>The size of these computers was smaller than earlier computers.</li><li>These computers used magnetic disks as their secondary storage devices.</li><li>Development of standard programming languages such as FORTRAN and BASIC.</li><li>The manufacturing cost of these computers was less compared to previous generations.</li><li>These computers used standard I/O devices such as keyboard, mouse, and monitors.</li><li>These systems were used for both scientific and commercial purposes.</li><li>They were more reliable and less prone to errors.</li></ul><p>The <strong>fourth generation</strong> of computers were manufactured in the years 1975–1989.</p><ul><li>These systems used microprocessors as the main electronic processing devices.</li><li>The size of these computers was very small compared to previous generations.</li><li>They consumed less power than third generation computers.</li><li>They used large primary and secondary storage compared to third generation.</li><li>These computers used standard high-level languages such as C, C++, JAVA, and Data Structures.</li><li>These systems could use GUI (Graphical User Interface).</li><li>They were more reliable and less prone to hardware failures than third generation.</li><li>These computers could be networked (e.g., Printing).</li></ul><p>The <strong>fifth generation computers</strong> were manufactured in the year 1989 onwards.</p><ul><li>Fifth generation computers used Artificial Intelligence

generation computers.</li><li>Fifth generation computers are faster than fourth generation.</li><li>They consume less power compared to fourth generation.</li><li>These computers are user-friendly and
