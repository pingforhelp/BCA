A program translates human logic into a form that hardware can execute. Think of it like writing a recipe for the computer. The recipe is the program, the ingredients are the data, and the steps are the instructions. The person who writes these instructions is called a <strong>Programmer</strong>, and they write them in a special language called a <u>programming language</u>. The entire set of instructions written in a programming language is called Source code. Programming matters:</p><ul><li>Automates tasks, performs, computations, fast.</li><li>Builds software systems (apps, OS, games, web-services).</li><li>Bridges <strong>problem-solving</strong> (algorithmic thinking) and machine execution.</li></ul><p>Types of software: Software is a collection of programs and data that tells a computer what to do. It is broadly divided into two main categories:</p><ol><li>System Software: This software acts as an intermediary between the computer hardware and the user&#39;s applications. Its main purpose is to manage the computer&#39;s resources. Examples: <ul><li>Operating Systems (OS): Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android. They manage all. other software and hardware on the computer.</li><li>Device Drivers: Software that allows the OS to communicate with hardware devices like printers, keyboards, and webcams.</li><li>Utilities: Programs designed for system maintenance, like antivirus software or disk cleanup tools.</li></ul></li><li>Application Software: This software is designed to perform specific tasks for the end-user. It runs on top of the system software. Examples:</li></ol><ul><li>Web Browsers: Mozilla Firefox, DuckDuckgo.</li><li>Word Processors: Microsoft Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice.</li><li>Games: Fortnite, Minecraft, CSGO</li><li>Media Players: VLC Media Player, MPCL.</li></ul><p><strong>Types Of Software:</strong></p><ol><li>System Application Software.</li><li>Operating System.</li><li>Language processor.</li><li>General purpose.</li><li>Customised Software and device drivers:</li></ol><ul><li>Linux.</li><li>Interpreter.</li><li>MS-word.</li><li>Railways Reservation System.</li><li>Windows.</li><li>Compiler.</li><li>Photoshop.</li></ul><p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41f390e5-91ec-496d-bd94-235dec1add27" alt="Unit_1_C pdf-image-000"><em>Fig.1.1 A Image showing types of Software.</em></p><h1 id="compiler-and-interpreter" tabindex="-1">Compiler and interpreter <a class="header-anchor" href="#compiler-and-interpreter" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Compiler and interpreter&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Computers only understand machine code (binary O’s and 1’s). Since we write programs in high-level languages (like C or Python), they need to be translated. Compilers and interpreters are two types of translator programs that do this job.</p><ul><li>Compiler: A compiler reads the entire source code at once and translates it into a complete machine code file called an executable or object file. This file can then be run by the computer.</li><li>Works: Scans the whole program and reports all errors at the end.</li><li>Advantage of compiler:</li><li>Execution Speed: Generally faster because the translation is done only once.</li><li>Examples: C, C++, Java use compilers.</li></ul><p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7e3b081-177a-4e49-8015-f0d5da58bbc0" alt="Unit_1_C pdf-image-001"><em>Fig.1.2 Compiler VS Interpreter.</em></p><ul><li>Interpreter: An interpreter reads the source code one line at a time, translates that line into machine code, and immediately executes it before moving to the next line.</li><li>Works: Translates and executes line-by-line. It stops as soon as it finds the first error.</li><li>Advantage of Interpreter:</li><li>➢ Execution Speed: Generally slower because translation happens every time the program is run.</li><li>➢ Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby use interpreters.</li></ul><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left;">Feature</th><th style="text-align:left;">Compiler</th><th style="text-align:left;">Interpreter</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Input</td><td style="text-align:left;">Entire program</td><td style="text-align:left;">Single line of code</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Output</td><td style="text-align:left;">Executable file (Machine code)</td><td style="text-align:left;">Immediate result (no file)</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Speed</td><td style="text-align:left;">Faster execution</td><td style="text-align:left;">Slower execution</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Error Checking</td><td style="text-align:left;">After scanning the whole program</td><td style="text-align:left;">After translating each line</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Debugging</td><td style="text-align:left;">Harder</td><td style="text-align:left;">Easier</td></tr></tbody></table><h1 id="concepts-of-machine-level-assembly-level-high-level-programming" tabindex="-1">Concepts of Machine level, Assembly level, High-level programming <a class="header-anchor" href="#concepts-of-machine-level-assembly-level-high-level-programming" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Concepts of Machine level, Assembly level, High-level programming&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Programming languages are categorized into three levels based on their abstraction from the hardware:</p><ol><li>Machine Language (also called Machine Code) Machine language is the lowest-level programming language, directly understood by the computer&#39;s central processing unit (CPU). It consists entirely of binary code (1s and Os) and represents the raw instructions that the CPU can execute:</li></ol><ul><li>This is the lowest level, consisting of binary digits (Os and 1s).</li><li>It is the only language a computer&#39;s CPU can directly understand.</li><li>It is extremely difficult for humans to read and write.</li><li>It is machine-dependent, meaning a program written for one computer might not work on another.</li></ul><p><strong>Example</strong>: A machine code instruction might look like 10110000 01100001, which could correspond to an operation like loading a value into a register on a specific CPU architecture.</p><ol start="2"><li>Assembly Level Language (Low-Level): Assembly language is a low-level programming language that serves as a symbolic representation of machine code. Each assembly language instruction corresponds directly to a machine language instruction, but the code is written using readable text and mnemonic codes rather than binary.</li></ol><ul><li>This is a step above machine language. It uses English-like mnemonics (short codes) to represent machine instructions, such as ADD for addition or MOV for moving data.</li><li>An assembler is required to translate assembly code into machine code.</li><li>It is easier to work with than machine language but is still machine-dependent.</li></ul><p><strong>Examples:</strong> Assembly Copy codeMOV AX, 1; Move the value 1 into register AX ADD AX,BX; Add the value in register BX to AX These are mnemonics and are typically converted to machine code by an assembler.</p><ol start="3"><li>High-Level Language (HLL): High-level languages are programming languages that provide a greater level of abstraction from the hardware, making them easier for humans to read and write. High-level languages are designed to be portable across different hardware platforms.</li></ol><ul><li>These languages use English-like syntax and are the easiest for humans to read, write, and maintain.</li><li>They are machine-independent, meaning a program can run on different types of computers with little or no modification.</li><li>They require a compiler or interpreter to be translated into machine code.</li></ul><p><strong>Examples:</strong> C, C++, Java, Python, and C#.</p><ul><li>Python: A very highlevel, interpreted language.</li><li>Java: A high-level, object-oriented language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine(JVM).</li><li>C/C++: High-level languages, though closer to the hardware than some others, still abstract many hardware details compared to assembly or machine code.</li></ul><h1 id="flowcharts-and-algorithms" tabindex="-1">Flowcharts and Algorithms <a class="header-anchor" href="#flowcharts-and-algorithms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Flowcharts and Algorithms&quot;">​</a></h1><p>What is a Algorithm?</p><ul><li>Algorithm is a finite set of steps used to solve computational problems in a program.</li><li>An algorithm development by the programmer to represent the basic logic of the selected solution.</li><li>An algorithm as it is a finite &amp; no. of steps of instructions that produce an output for a set of input values.</li><li>An algorithm written in simple English language.</li><li>To make an effective algorithm the steps must be define with finite sequence of instruction.</li></ul><img width="264" height="454" alt="Unit_1_C pdf-image-002" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee093cab-6c8d-4451-977b-8473cf74bfe3"><p><em>Fig.1.3 An image describing a Flow chart</em></p><p><strong>Properties of algorithm The algorithm has five properties such as:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Input</strong>: Input  An algorithm must have &#39;0&#39; or more no. of well defined inputs. Example: <code>printf(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);</code>. There is no input but it provides an output <code>Hello, world!</code></li><li><strong>Output:</strong> The algorithm must have at least one output, we cannot say that zero outputs. Example:</li><li><strong>Finiteness:</strong> The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps. To each instruction &amp; step in an algorithm must have clear meaning. Example: <code>while ( ) { Set of Statements; }</code> This loop executes a finite number of times.</li><li><strong>Unambiguous:</strong> The algorithm must have Unambiguous instructions, every instructions must have clear meaning. The algorithm should not have any unambigies instructions.</li><li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> The algorithm must provide effective result.
