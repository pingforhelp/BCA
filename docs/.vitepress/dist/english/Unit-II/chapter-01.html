Value of Relationships &gt; Value of Possessions</p><p>A) The joys atmosphere of the fair serves as a powerful contrast to the child&#39;s fear and loss. The vibrant colours, music and laughter of the fair initially captivate the child but after he is separated from his parents the same sights and sounds become terrifying and meaningless. The happiness of the crowd highlight his profound loneliness and distress making his sense of being lost even more acute.</p><p>B) What is the significance of the title <em>The Lost Child</em>? Do you think the story is about only a child lost in a fair? Does it symbolise something deeper about human life and relationships?</p><p>C) The title &quot;The Lost Child&quot; has both a literal and a symbolic significance. Literally, it refers to the child who is physically lost in the fair. Symbolically, it represents a deeper truth about human life and relationships. The story suggests that without the security of love and family, all other worldly desires and possessions are meaningless. The child&#39;s loss of his Parents. Is a metaphor for the loss of security and belonging that all humans experience at some point in their lives. The fair, with its distractions and temptations, represents the world and its fleeting pleasures.</p><p>The story ==highlights== the importance of human connection and the devastating consequences of isolation==. The child&#39;s journey through the fair is a microcosm of the human experience, reminding us that true happiness lies not in material possessions but in the love and support of others.</p></div></div></main><footer class="VPDocFooter" data-v-39a288b8 data-v-e257564d><!--[--><!--]--><!----><!----></footer><!--[--><!--]--></div></div></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><!----><!--[--><!--]--></div></div>
