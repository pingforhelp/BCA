# Q1 What are the functions of the CPU? Short
Ans: ==Central Processing Unit (CPU) The CPU is the brain of the computer.== It has 2 major Sub-units:
I. Arithmetic & Logic Unit (ALU): Performs Arithmetic operations and Logical operations. e.g., +, %, x. AND, OR, NOT, and & !;
II. Control Unit;
- Controls and Coordinates all Components.
- Fetches, decodes and executes instructions.
- Maintain the sequence of operations.
III. Registers: Smallest and fastest memory locations in CPU temporarily hold data, instructions, and addresses;
> [!example]
> PC, ACC, Instructions Register (IR).
IV. Interfaces: Since CPU and I/O devices work at different speeds but interface helps in communication between Components.
> [!example]
> I/O Module;
> Buffer;
> Control Signals.
 
Some of the important functions of the Central processing unit (CPU) are:
- Processing.

# Q13 Describe the process of mail merge. Long ++IMP++
Ans: Mail Merge feature in MS Word allows you to merge an address file with a form letter in order to generate multiple copies of the same letter, with one copy for each address in your file. This automates the task of generating the same letter for multiple recipients. It is a process of combining generic information (such as a form letter or mass e-mail) with specific information (such as a specific recipient’s e-mail address, name, or title/subject). For instance, HR needs to inform all employees of a holiday. Or someone wants to send invitations to a lot of people for a event.

# Q14 Explain Goal Seek with a suitable example.
Ans: Goal Seek feature is a *what-if analysis* tool that enables you to find the input needed to achieve a goal or objective. To use Goal Seek, you select the cell containing that will return the result you’re seeking and then indicate the target value you formula to return and the location of the input value that Excel can change to reach 


# Q15 What is Split View in Excel? Explain its benefits.
Ans: **Split View** in Microsoft Excel is a display feature that allows you to divide a single worksheet into either two or four separate panes. Each pane provides an independent scrollable view of the same sheet, meaning you can look at two different areas of a large dataset simultaneously without jumping back and forth.

Benefits of Split View
1. **Simultaneous Data Comparison:**
It allows you to view and compare data from the top of a massive spreadsheet with data at the very bottom. This is essential for auditing or cross-checking totals against individual line items.
2. **Efficient Data Entry:**
If you are entering data in one section based on information located in a distant part of the sheet (e.g., cell $A1$ informs a calculation in cell $Z5000$), you can keep both areas visible at once to reduce errors.
3. **Four-Way Navigation:**
By splitting both horizontally and vertically, you can create four quadrants. This is particularly useful for tracking row headers on the left and column totals on the right while still navigating the central body of the data.
4. **Independent Scrolling:**
Each pane operates with its own scroll bars. This flexibility ensures that you aren't "locked" into a specific row or column, which provides a more dynamic workspace than traditional freezing.

# Q16 What is a formula? What are the different formulas used in spreadsheets?
Ans: Formula are equations that perform calculations on data values in the Worksheet. Like any Calculator excel can execute formulas that   +, -, /, X. A formula can be a combination of constant values, cell reference, and mathematical operatiors (+, =, ×, *, -).
Different formulas:
- Arithmetic Formulas
- Statistical Functions
- Logical Formulas
- Text Formulas

# Q17 Explain logical functions in spreadsheets.
Ans: A function in Excel is a predefined formula that performs specific calculations or operations. Functions are built-in and can be used to simplify complex calculations or manipulate data in cells.

# Q19 What is What-If Analysis in Excel? Explain Goal Seek, Scenario Manager, and Data Tables. Long
Ans: What-If analysis is a set of tools that allow you to explore the impact of changes ata on the outcome of a formula or calculation. This can be useful for making about how to change your data or how to set your goals. This feature allows you to e data used in a formula in order to find out what the results will be. The different then be compared to find out which one best suit your requirements.

**Goal Seek feature** is a *what-if* analysis tool that enables you to find the input eded to achieve a goal or objective. To use Goal Seek, you select the cell containing that will return the result you’re seeking and then indicate the target value you formula to return and the location of the input value that Excel can change to reach

**Scenario Manager** The use of Scenario Manager in Excel allows you to have a certain set of inputs for a “scenario”, and then lets you view different scenarios of the outputs as the change. Basically, it tells you “if this were to change”, “this is the result”; and it allows to happen for multiple cases or “scenarios”. This can help give people information to decisions on their business (or whatever it may be used for) based on the different as displayed by Scenario Manager. Scenario Manager lets you create and save sets of different input values that produce calculated results as named scenarios (such as Best Case, Worst Case, and Most Case). The key to creating the various scenarios for a table is to identify the various the data whose values can vary in each scenario.

# Q20 Explain step-by-step process on how to insert charts and sparklines in Excel. Long ++IMP++
Ans: To create a new chart, you must first enter the data into a worksheet. This section explains how you can create simple charts from the data.
