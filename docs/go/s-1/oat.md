# Q1 What are the functions of the CPU? <u>Short</u>
Ans: ==Central Processing Unit (CPU) The CPU is the brain of the computer.== It has 2 major Sub-units:
I. Arithmetic & Logic Unit (ALU): Performs Arithmetic operations and Logical operations. e.g., +, %, x. AND, OR, NOT, and & !;
II. Control Unit;
- Controls and Coordinates all Components.
- Fetches, decodes and executes instructions.
- Maintain the sequence of operations.
III. Registers: Smallest and fastest memory locations in CPU temporarily hold data, instructions, and addresses;
> [!example]
> PC, ACC, Instructions Register (IR).
IV. Interfaces: Since CPU and I/O devices work at different speeds but interface helps in communication Components.
> [!example]
> I/O Module;
> Buffer;
> Control Signals.

# Q2 Explain the history of computers. <u>Long</u>
Ans: 
I The Abacus (4000 BCE)
The abacus, created by the Chinese, is often regarded as the first computing device. It consisted of beads strung on rods and was used to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction. Over time, different versions of the abacus spread across Asia, becoming an essential tool for calculations;
II Differential Analyzer (1930s) Differential Analyzer was the first electronic computer introduced in the year 1930 in the United States. It was basically an analog device that was invented by Vannevar Bush. This machine consists of vacuum tubes to switch electrical signals to perform calculations. It was capable of doing 25 calculations in a few minutes;
III Transistor Computers (1950s) In the 1950s, the invention of the transistor revolutionized computing. Transistors were smaller, more reliable, and energy-efficient compared to vacuum tubes. They played a key role in making computers more compact and affordable;
IV Minicomputers and Microcomputers With the development of the microprocessor, the size of computers shrank even further, leading to the creation of affordable minicomputers like the PDP-8 and PDP-11. These smaller systems paved the way for the personal computer revolution;
V Apple II (1977) The Apple II, developed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, was one of the first successful personal computers. It used a microprocessor and could run basic software applications like word processors and games;
VI Cloud Computing (2000s-Present) Cloud computing allowshave been users to store and access data remotely via the internet, making it easier to scale computing resources. Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) transformed how businesses and individuals manage data;
VII Artificial Intelligence (AI) AI is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of modern computing. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms enable computers to make decisions, recognize patterns, and even understand human language, leading to advancements in everything from virtual assistants to autonomous vehicles.

# Q3 How do you convert a binary number into decimal system? Explain with an example. <u>Could BE 4 or 10 Marker</u>
Ans: Go to [U-1 notes](https://notes.tamims.space/computer-sci/computer-fundamentals/computer_fundamentals_unit-1)

# Q5 What are the various generations of computers? Explain in detail (Or) Explain the evolution of computers from mechanical devices to modern-day systems. Include key milestones (Yes, Q2 is the yes answer as OR just add modern part of the answer).
Ans: [Click Here (tooo lazy to pasta from the aother file)](https://notes.tamims.space/computer-sci/computer-fundamentals/computer_fundamentals_unit-1#different-between-h-s) For OR watch this [Video (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjVX47dLlN8) For "modern" bit of the answer use a computer and write about how ~~AI generated code block you from unlocking it~~. Not THAT AI can code compilers you get the picture.

# Q6. What is a control unit? What are its actions? <u>Short</u>
Ans: CU short for Control Unit Directs the flow of data between input, memory, and output units. <insert> something to make the answer longer maybe block Diagram of a computer.

# Q7 What are the applications of MAN? <u>Long</u>
Ans: 

# Q8 Explain about various  input and output devices. <u>Can be both</u>
Ans: NO need.

# Q9 What is a web browser? What are the various parts of a browser window? <u>I don't know</u>
Ans: Web browser is an application software used to explore the WWW. It acts as a platform that allows users to access information from the internet by serving as an interface between the client (user) & the server. It acts as a The browser sends requests to servers for web documents. images, links, styles, & scripts.

- Extensions are small programs that add extra features and functionality to your web browser. They can customize the browser's appearance, block ads, manage passwords, translate web pages, and much more. Extensions are typically developed by third-party developers and installed from app stores specific to each browser (e.g., Firefox Add-ons). They enhance parts of the web browser capabilities. Some of popular Extensions are Dark reader, ReadAloud, VPNs, Adblockers, Add-ons for specific websites Process Feedback for Google Docs.
- Tabs are used to display different webpages on the same window of the web browser. On modern browsers one can open multiple "Windows" with tens of "tabs" in each window. Of course it will Utilize more system resources. 
- URL Bar used to "type in" the IP address or domain name of a Server. On modern browsers it shows useful information like if the website is 'Secured' with HTTPS or not. It is smart with auto-completion of the URL based on users previous activity.
- Bookmarks are useful for saving unfinished articles, resources, lists, books. used by Students and researchers to keep their sources in one place.
- Split-tabs and PIP (play in picture) these features let's the user open two or more tabs in one tab. PIP is useful while following instructions and performing them in another program.

# Q10 Explain about character formatting techniques.
Ans: 
# Q11 Explain the different types of shortcut keys used in MS Word. <u>Can be both</u>
Ans: I'll try to cover all the popular ones and important ones. Pls DM me if I miss something important.

# Q12 How do you open and close a document in MS Word? (They won't ask such a basic Q&A in College exam will they?)
Ans: Not needed.
# Q13 Describe the process of mail merge <u>Long</u> ++IMP++
Ans: Mail Merge feature in MS Word allows you to merge an address file with a form letter in order to generate multiple copies of the same letter, with one copy for each address in your file. This automates the task of generating the same letter for multiple recipients. It is a process of combining generic information (such as a form letter or mass e-mail) with specific information (such as a specific recipient’s e-mail address, name, or title/subject). For instance, HR needs to inform all employees of a holiday. Or someone wants to send invitations to a lot of people for a event.
