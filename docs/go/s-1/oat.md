# Q1 What are the functions of the CPU? <u>Short</u>
Ans: ==Central Processing Unit (CPU) The CPU is the brain of the computer.== It has 2 major Sub-units:
I. Arithmetic & Logic Unit (ALU): Performs Arithmetic operations and Logical operations. e.g., +, %, x. AND, OR, NOT, and & !;
II. Control Unit;
- Controls and Coordinates all Components.
- Fetches, decodes and executes instructions.
- Maintain the sequence of operations.
III. Registers: Smallest and fastest memory locations in CPU temporarily hold data, instructions, and addresses;
> [!example]
> PC, ACC, Instructions Register (IR).
IV. Interfaces: Since CPU and I/O devices work at different speeds but interface helps in communication Components.
> [!example]
> I/O Module;
> Buffer;
> Control Signals.


# Q2 Explain the history of computers. <u>Long</u>
Ans: 
I The Abacus (4000 BCE)
The abacus, created by the Chinese, is often regarded as the first computing device. It consisted of beads strung on rods and was used to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction. Over time, different versions of the abacus spread across Asia, becoming an essential tool for calculations;
II Differential Analyzer (1930s) Differential Analyzer was the first electronic computer introduced in the year 1930 in the United States. It was basically an analog device that was invented by Vannevar Bush. This machine consists of vacuum tubes to switch electrical signals to perform calculations. It was capable of doing 25 calculations in a few minutes;
III Transistor Computers (1950s) In the 1950s, the invention of the transistor revolutionized computing. Transistors were smaller, more reliable, and energy-efficient compared to vacuum tubes. They played a key role in making computers more compact and affordable;
IV Minicomputers and Microcomputers With the development of the microprocessor, the size of computers shrank even further, leading to the creation of affordable minicomputers like the PDP-8 and PDP-11. These smaller systems paved the way for the personal computer revolution;
V Apple II (1977) The Apple II, developed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, was one of the first successful personal computers. It used a microprocessor and could run basic software applications like word processors and games;
VI Cloud Computing (2000s-Present) Cloud computing allowshave been users to store and access data remotely via the internet, making it easier to scale computing resources. Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) transformed how businesses and individuals manage data;
VII Artificial Intelligence (AI) AI is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of modern computing. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms enable computers to make decisions, recognize patterns, and even understand human language, leading to advancements in everything from virtual assistants to autonomous vehicles.

# Q3 How do you convert a binary number into decimal system? Explain with an example. <u>Could BE 4 or 10 Marker</u>
Ans: Go to [U-1 notes](https://notes.tamims.space/computer-sci/computer-fundamentals/computer_fundamentals_unit-1)

# Q5 What are the various generations of computers? Explain in detail (Or) Explain the evolution of computers from mechanical devices to modern-day systems. Include key milestones (Yes, Q2 is the yes answer as OR just add modern part of the answer).
Ans: [Click Here (tooo lazy to pasta from the aother file)](https://notes.tamims.space/computer-sci/computer-fundamentals/computer_fundamentals_unit-1#different-between-h-s) For OR watch this [Video (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjVX47dLlN8) For "modern" bit of the answer use a computer and write about how ~~AI generated code block you from unlocking it~~. Not THAT AI can code compilers you get the picture.

# Q6. What is a control unit? What are its actions? <u>Short</u>
Ans: CU short for Control Unit Directs the flow of data between input, memory, and output units. <insert> something to make the answer longer. ~~This is the one thing everyone has learnt in the last 6mo instead skills or our course (Just saying).~~

# Q7 What are the applications of MAN? <u>Long</u>
Ans:
