Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad and rapidly evolving field of computer science focused on designing and building machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. 

These tasks include:
- **Learning** – the ability to improve performance based on experience (e.g., machine learning algorithms that learn from data)
- **Problem-solving** – finding solutions to complex problems (e.g., optimizing routes, solving puzzles)
- **Decision-making** – making choices under uncertainty (e.g., medical diagnosis systems)
- **Perception** – interpreting sensory data like images, sounds, or videos (e.g., facial recognition)
- **Language understanding** – processing and generating human language (e.g., chatbots, translation tools)

# IMP Topics
AI systems aim to replicate or simulate human cognitive functions using algorithms, statistical models, and data-driven approaches.

Types of AI
1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)** – Designed for a specific task (e.g., voice assistants, recommendation systems).  
2. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)** – Designed for a specific task (e.g., voice assistants, recommendation systems).  
3. **Super AI** – Hypothetical systems that surpass human intelligence across all domains.

AI Techniques
- **Machine Learning** – Systems that learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
- **Deep Learning** – A subset of machine learning using neural networks with many layers.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Enabling machines to understand and generate human language.
- **Computer Vision** – Allowing machines to interpret visual information.
