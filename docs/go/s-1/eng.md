# SUMMARY (Unit-1, Ch01)
In stanza 1, the poet asks the fishermen to “Rise”, as the day is about to appear. She says that the sky which was sleeping in the night has woken up and is welcoming the light. Here the poet uses personification by using awakening (a human activity) for the sky (a non-living thing).

Next, she says that the sea-wind that leads to the storm is now calm because of the morning which is about to come. Thus the wind is just like the child which kept crying throughout the night and now he is quiet. Here the poet uses simile to compare calm wind with a child. In the 3rd line, the poet asks the fishermen to collect their nets from the sea-shores and take their boats because the tide is full of wealth (fishes, sea-gulls etc) and they are the kings. They just need to go to the sea to capture the wealth that is theirs. Hence they should hurry.

In stanza 2, the poet asks the fishermen to do everything fast. The sea-gull’s call is a symbol to depict that morning is near. The poet calls sea as their mother, cloud as brother and sea waves as comrades i.e. companions. Here again, the poet uses personification. Sea is considered the mother because it feeds them and helps them to sustain their life. Similarly, clouds are their brothers because they guide the fishermen while the waves are companions because they keep moving with them. The poet thus wants to say that they all are family and help each other. She urges them not to fear because even if they could not return by the sunset, the sea-god which according to her, holds the sea-storm by the hair will save them.

In the final stanza, the poet says that the shade of the coconut glade, the scent of mango grove and the sands at the full o’ the moon with the sound of the voices they love are sweet and enjoyable but these joys are temporary. Rather they should go for the kiss of the spray i.e., the water drops falling on the face while in the sea and the dance of the foam’s glee, the foam which forms by the up-down movement of the tides which, according to the poet, are sweeter and work-struggling.

In the last line, she asks the fishermen to depart for the point in the sea where the sun meets the sky i.e., horizon. Symbolically, it refers to infinity or a place without end. In this perspective, she asks the fishermen to dive into the infinite sea.

# SUMMARY (Unit-1, Ch02)
The narrator, a college student, spends his summers at his grandmother’s home in Dehra. On his way there, his train always halts for ten minutes at the small, lonely Deoli railway station, where hardly anyone gets on or off. One summer, he notices a young girl selling baskets on the platform. She is poor, barefoot, and simply dressed, but her beauty and dignity strike him deeply.

Though he first refuses to buy a basket, her persistence makes him purchase one, and in that brief exchange, they silently form a connection. On his return journey two months later, he sees her again. Their reunion is filled with unspoken emotions; he even holds her hand and feels an urge to take her away with him. But the train departs, leaving him with only her memory.

The following summer, eager to see her, he returns to Deoli. To his disappointment, the girl is gone. The station master and locals know nothing about her. Restless and disheartened, he continues to look for her each time he passes through Deoli, but she never reappears.

He finally resigns himself to the mystery. Though he longs to know her fate, he chooses not to break his journey at Deoli. Instead, he prefers to keep her alive in memory and dream, fearing the truth might shatter the beauty of his cherished encounter.

# SUMMARY (Unit-2 Ch01)
The story is set during the spring festival when people thronged to the fair in a joyful mood. Among them was a little boy who walked with his parents, fascinated by the toys, sweets, and attractions along the way. Each time he expressed a desire—for toys, sweets, garlands, balloons, or the roundabout—he knew his parents would refuse, so he suppressed his wishes and moved on.

As they entered the fair, the child was captivated by the sights and sounds, but suddenly he realized his parents were not beside him. Fear and panic gripped him as he searched everywhere, crying “Mother, Father!” His joy and curiosity vanished, replaced only by the desperate longing to be with his parents.

A kind stranger noticed the weeping boy and tried to console him by offering rides, balloons, flowers, and sweets. However, the child rejected everything he had earlier desired and only repeated his one plea: “I want my mother, I want my father.”

The story highlights the innocence of childhood. While the child is initially drawn to material things, the moment he is separated from his parents, he realizes that nothing in the world matters more than the love and security of his parents.

# SUMMARY (Unit-2 Ch02)
The letter is addressed to a teacher by a former student who feels neglected and failed by the education system. The student accuses the teacher of ignoring struggling pupils, pushing them out of school into labour, and showing little concern for their personal struggles. He contrasts the teacher’s formal education with his own practical knowledge of life, family, and community. While teachers boast of culture and bookish knowledge, they fail to understand or respect the lived experiences of working-class children. The student highlights the unfairness of judging them by irrelevant standards—such as knowing basketball—when their real skills, like hard physical labour and community ties, are dismissed. The letter urges humility from teachers, pointing out that their own culture has serious gaps, which make them less capable of understanding the majority of the world’s people.

# SUMMARY (Unit-4, Ch01)
Nissim Ezekiel’s poem Night of the Scorpion describes a night in a rural Indian village when the poet’s mother is stung by a scorpion. As soon as the scorpion disappears into the dark room, villagers gather at the house and begin to chant prayers and give superstitious explanations, believing that her suffering will burn away her sins. The poet’s father, who trusts in science rather than superstition, tries various methods—powder, herbs, and even pouring paraffin on the wound—to ease her pain. The mother continues to suffer for many hours until the poison finally loses its effect. At the end, she expresses gratitude that the scorpion stung her and not her children. The poem highlights the clash between superstition and rational thought, while also bringing out the deep love and sacrifice of a mother.

# SUMMARY (Unit-4, Ch02)
Refund by Fritz Karinthy is a humorous one-act play that satirizes the education system and human greed. The story revolves around Wasserkopf, a middle-aged man who returns to his old school demanding a refund of his tuition fees. He argues that his education was useless because he has failed in life and blames his teachers for not preparing him adequately.

The principal, along with four teachers, decides to test Wasserkopf to see if he truly learned nothing. Ironically, Wasserkopf gives ridiculous and absurd answers to all the questions, but the teachers cleverly twist his answers to prove him “brilliant”. For example, when he gives a wrong answer, the teachers interpret it as clever thinking, logical reasoning, or originality.

In the end, Wasserkopf, who expected to be declared unfit and refunded, is instead declared a genius by the teachers. The principal then tells him that since he has passed with distinction, he owes the school additional examination fees. Thus, the greedy man is tricked by the very teachers he wanted to outsmart. The play exposes the flaws of the education system, the tendency of teachers to justify their own teaching, and human foolishness driven by greed.

# SUMMARY (Unit-5 Ch01)
*An Astrologer’s Day* is set in a busy marketplace where an astrologer sits every evening to earn his living. He does not have real knowledge of astrology but relies on shrewd observation, guesses, and people’s gullibility. He wears a turban, beard, and sacred ash, which gives him an air of mystery and helps him attract customers.

One evening, as he is about to pack up, a stranger comes to him and challenges him to prove his skill. The man insists that the astrologer should either tell him the truth about his past or refund the money. Pressured, the astrologer begins his reading. He describes the man’s past with surprising accuracy—how he was once stabbed and left for dead by someone, and how he narrowly escaped death. He further warns the man never to return to his native village, or he will be killed. Shocked by the revelation, the stranger pays him and leaves.

Afterward, the astrologer feels relieved. He confides to his wife that the man was his old enemy, whom he had attacked years ago and believed to be dead. That crime had forced him to leave his village and take up the life of an astrologer. Fate had brought them together again, but now the astrologer is free of his fear, as his enemy is alive and has gone away.

# What do you find most appealing in the Poem; It's rhythm, imagery (or) message? (Ch01 Class)

# Briefly narrate the conversation between the narrator and the girl in their second meeting. (Ch01 Class,)
Ans: *The Night Train at Deoli* is a story about the narrator’s love for a poor basket-seller whom he met at a small station while on his way to Dehra. He met the girl only once and never saw her again, yet she remained in his memory. On his return journey, he looked for her and found her. They were happy to see each other like long-lost friends, though they did not speak a word—their silence spoke more than words. He felt like staying with her but did not do so. He told her that he needed to go to Delhi, and she replied softly that he need not go anywhere, perhaps expressing her wish to keep him there. Both of them separated unwillingly as the train left the station with the hope of meeting again. The meeting helped to break the monotony of his journey and gave him a sense of attachment and responsibility toward the girl. Even after the journey, for a long time later, he kept thinking of the girl he met at the station at Deoli.

# Why did the narrator never break his journey at Deoli, though he wished to meet the girl? (Ch02 Mid-2)
Ans: Although the narrator wished to stop at Deoli, he feared destroying the idealized image he had created. The uncertainty and the possibility of reality not matching his dream held him back:
1. Tenderness or Affection He remembered the girl fondly. Even though he met her only twice, the brief encounter touched his heart deeply.
2. Longing and Desire The narrator felt a deep sense of longing for the girl. He wished he could see her again or at least know what happened to her, but she remained only a beautiful memory.
3. Sadness and Regret There was sorrow in his heart because he never met her again and missed the chance to express his feelings. He regretted not acting on impulse to know her better.
4. Nostalgia Over the years, the memory of the girl became a symbol of lost youth and innocent love. Thinking of her brought back emotions of that time—pure, simple, and unforgettable.

# Q2. When the narrator first saw the basket-selling girl, what attracted him to her? (Ch02 Class)
Ans: When the narrator first saw the basket-selling girl, he was immediately struck by her appearance and demeanor. She seemed young, perhaps around twelve years old, and was dressed in simple, worn clothes that reflected her humble background. Despite her poverty, there was a sense of dignity in the way she carried herself. Her eyes were bright and expressive, revealing both innocence and determination.

The narrator noticed her graceful movements as she balanced the basket on her head, and her face showed a mixture of hope and resilience. His first impression was of a hardworking, earnest girl who faced challenges with quiet strength.
