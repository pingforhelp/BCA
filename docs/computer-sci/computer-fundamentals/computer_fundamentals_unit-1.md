A computer is an **electronic** machine designed to take input, process it, and display output as **pre-defined instructions**.

Hardware i.e., the physical **components** and software are the programming.
The computer operates on IPO (Input, Processing, Output).

* **Input**: Data is fed in the computer via input devices such as a mouse or keyboard.

* **Processing**: The data is processed by **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** according to instructions.

* **Output**: The processed information (data) is delivered via output devices like a **monitor** and printer.

* A computer can store data using **primary memory (RAM)** for temporary use or **secondary memory** for long storage.

* **RAM** refers to Random Access Memory.

* **ROM** refers to Read Only Memory. It **cannot** change files in the computer; it only stores instructions that can be read, not written, by a user.

**Characteristics of computer:**
1. **Speed** – A computer can process **billions of instructions** per second. Modern processors have speed measured in **GHz**, meaning they can handle **billions of cycles** per second.
2. **Accuracy** – Computers follow instructions and produce all results without errors, except for bugs or human error.
3. **Automation** – Once programmed, a computer operates automatically.
4. **Storage** – Computers store vast amounts of data in primary memory.
5. **Versatility** – A simple computer can perform many tasks such as playing a movie or editing a document.
6. **Diligence** – A computer can perform repetitive tasks without pause.
7. **Cost-effectiveness** – The automation and speed of computers reduce the time and manpower required to complete tasks.

It lists its main components and their interactions.
* **Input Unit** – Devices like the keyboard, mouse, and scanner **convert user data and instructions** into a format that the computer can understand.
   * **CPU** – The brain of the computer, responsible for processing all instructions.
   * **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** – **Performs arithmetic and logical operations**, e.g., +, −, ×, <, >, =.
   * **CU (Control Unit)** – **Directs** the flow of data between input, memory, and output units.
   * **Memory Unit** – Stores data and instructions.
   * **Output Unit** – Converts processed data into a **human-readable** form.

# Different between h/s.  
All are five Generations;  
The Computer Generations can be classified into five categories:  
1. First Generation  
2. Second Generation  
3. Third Generation  
4. Fourth Generation  
5. Fifth Generation  

The **first generation** used vacuum tubes as the main electronic response for processing data.  
- The first generations were from 1942–1955.  
- These computers were physically large and required huge rooms.  
- Used magnetic drums for memory storage.  
- Used punched cards and paper tapes for input/output.  
Disadvantages:  
- They consumed more power.  
- These computers were large in size.  
- These computers produced a large amount of heat.  
- They had limited commercial use.  

The **second generation** computers were manufactured in the years 1955–1964.  
- These computers used transistors in place of vacuum tubes.  
- They were smaller in size and required less space for installation.  
- They used magnetic tapes as secondary storage devices.  
- They consumed less power and produced less amount of heat.  
- They were about 10 times faster than first generation computers.  
- They were more reliable.  
- Less prone to hardware failure compared to the first generation.  

The **third generation** computers were manufactured in the years 1964–1975.  
- These computers used integrated circuits (ICs) instead of vacuum tubes and transistors.  
- The size of these computers was smaller than earlier computers.  
- These computers used magnetic disks as their secondary storage devices.  
- Development of standard programming languages such as FORTRAN and BASIC.  
- The manufacturing cost of these computers was less compared to previous generations.  
- These computers used standard I/O devices such as keyboard, mouse, and monitors.  
- These systems were used for both scientific and commercial purposes.  
- They were more reliable and less prone to errors.  

The **fourth generation** of computers were manufactured in the years 1975–1989.  
- These systems used microprocessors as the main electronic processing devices.  
- The size of these computers was very small compared to previous generations.  
- They consumed less power than third generation computers.  
- They used large primary and secondary storage compared to third generation.  
- These computers used standard high-level languages such as C, C++, JAVA, and Data Structures.  
- These systems could use GUI (Graphical User Interface).  
- They were more reliable and less prone to hardware failures than third generation.  
- These computers could be networked (e.g., Printing).  

The **fifth generation computers** were manufactured in the year 1989 onwards.  
- Fifth generation computers used Artificial Intelligence (AI) instead of ICs and transistors.  
- AI is a branch of Computer Science that aims to make computers behave like humans.  
- These computers are portable and much smaller than fourth generation computers.  
- Fifth generation computers are faster than fourth generation.  
- They consume less power compared to fourth generation.  
- These computers are user-friendly and support multimedia.  
- The goal of fifth generation devices is to respond to human languages such as English and Hindi.  

# Number Systems
1. Binary – Bi 2 uses 0 & 1 – Base/Radix is 2 e.g. (11011)₂  
2. Octal system Oct 8 digits from 0 to 7 Base/Radix is 8 – e.g. (11011)₈  
3. Decimal Dec  10 digits from 0 to 9 – Base/Radix is 10 – e.g. (101101)₁₀  
4. Hexadecimal – Hexa – 16 – digits 0 to 15 or A to F – Base/Radix is 16 – e.g. (1011011)₁₆  

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] 
                                → A  B  C  D  E  F
