Q1. What is a computer? *++5 marks++*

Ans: 

- A computer is an electronic machine designed to take input (>>), process  it (+, -, etc...), and display output (<<). Based on ==pre-defined instructions== (Programs). 

- Nowadays IT (Computer) is everywhere from a smart locks to airplanes

- The Computer works ==with== Software and Hardware to perform aformentioned "instructions".
- It comes in all sizes and form factors based on the use-cases and power limitations.
- The computer operates using the IPO cycle Input processing and  output.
- It saves time by doing repetitive tasks with litte or no human intervention.
- e.g., of Computers Server, Mobile phones, IOT,  basically any electronic machine with screen on it.

Q2. What are input and output devices? ++*5 marks*++

Ans (pt.1): Input devices are used to "enter" or send data to convert into a format that the Computer can understand i.e., 0's and 1's.

e.g., of I/P devices:
- Mouse a device used to point to the screen to interact with the Computer.
- Keyword a device that is used to type data into the system.
-  Touch Pen used for making 'digital art' on a computer.
- Sensors used for starting/stoping/ un-locking/locking e.g., a fingerprint sensor.
- Gamepad/joypad used for playing video games.
- Touch screens much like keyboard and mouse but can operated using one's fingers.

Ans (pt.2): Output the processed information/data is delivered via output devices in hard or soft form.

e.g., of O/P devices:
- Printer used to print out physical copies of documents.
- Headphones used to listen to sound.
- AV Receiver used send to audio to other speakers.
- Monitor a device used to view the output returned by the computer/CPU.

Q3. Write about the Generations of computer?  /*++10 marks*++

Ans:

The "Generations" in this context means that the improvements in technology over a period of time.

The **first generation** used vacuum tubes as the main electronic response for processing data.  
- The first generations were from 1942–1955.  
- These computers were physically large and required huge rooms.
- Used magnetic drums for memory storage.and punched cards or paper tapes for I/O.  

**Disadvantages**:  
- They consumed more power.  
- These computers were large in size.  
- These computers produced a large amount of heat.  
- They had limited commercial use.  

The **second generation** computers were manufactured in the years 1955-1964.  
- These computers used transistors in place of vacuum tubes.  
- They were smaller in size and required less space for installation. 
- They used magnetic tapes as secondary storage devices.  
- They consumed less power and produced less amount of heat.  
- They were about 10 times faster than first generation computers.  
- They were more reliable.  
- Less prone to hardware failure compared to the first generation.  

The **third generation** computers were manufactured in the years 1964–1975.  
- These computers used integrated circuits (ICs) instead of vacuum tubes and transistors.  
- The size of these computers was smaller than earlier computers.  
- These computers used magnetic disks as their secondary storage devices.  
- Development of standard programming languages such as FORTRAN and BASIC.
- The manufacturing cost of these computers was less compared to previous generations.  
- These computers used standard I/O devices such as keyboard, mouse, and monitors.  
- These systems were used for both scientific and commercial purposes.  
- They were more reliable and less prone to errors.  

The **fourth generation** of computers were manufactured in the years 1975–1989.  
- These systems used microprocessors as the main electronic processing devices.  
- The size of these computers was very small compared to previous generations. 
- They consumed less power than third generation computers.  
- They used large primary and secondary storage compared to third generation.  
- These computers used standard high-level languages such as C, C++, JAVA, and Data Structures.  
- These systems could use GUI (Graphical User Interface).  
- They were more reliable and less prone to hardware failures than third generation.  
- These computers could be networked (e.g., Printing, sharing files).  

The **fifth generation** computers are  manufactured in the year 1989 onwards.  
- Fifth generation computers used Artificial Intelligence (AI) instead of ICs and transistors.  
- AI is a branch of Computer Science that aims to make computers behave like humans.  
- These computers are portable and much smaller than fourth generation computers.  
- These computers are faster than fourth generation.  
- They consume less power compared to fourth generation.  
- These computers are user-friendly and supports multimedia.  
- The goal of fifth generation devices is to respond to human languages such as English and Hindi.

Q4. Types of computers?  /++*10 marks*++

Ans: 


Q5. Block diagram of CPU? & explain parts of CPU *++10 marks*++

Ans: It lists its main components and their interactions.

* **Input Unit** Devices like the keyboard, mouse, and scanner **convert user data and instructions** into a format that the computer can understand.

* **CPU** The brain of the computer, responsible for processing all instructions.
   - **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** – **Performs arithmetic and logical operations**, e.g., +, −, ×, <, >, !, &.
    - **CU (Control Unit)** – **Directs** the flow of data between input, memory, and output units.
    - **Memory Unit** – Stores data and instructions.

* **Output Unit** Converts processed data into a **human-readable** form.

Q6. Characteristics of computer. ++*5 marks*++

1. **Speed** A computer can process *billions of instructions* per second. Modern processors have speed measured in ==GHz==, meaning they can handle **billions of cycles per second.  
2. **Accuracy** Computers follow instructions and produce all results without errors, except for bugs or human error.  
3. **Automation** Once programmed, a computer operates automatically.  
4. **Storage** – Computers store vast amounts of data in primary memory.  
5. **Versatility** – A simple computer can perform many tasks such as playing a movie or editing a document.  
6. **Diligence** – A computer can perform repetitive tasks without a break.  
7. **Cost-effectiveness** – The automation and speed of computers reduce the time and manpower required to complete tasks.  

Q7. What is Number System? & types. */5 marks* 

Ans: number is nothing but giving value to a symbol. System is nothing how or from where we start assigning the value.

1. Binary  
2. Decimal  
3. Octal  
4. Hexadecimal  

Q8. Explain types of number systems with suitable examples (like [2.3], [64], [24.23]).  (Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal).  /10 marks

Ans:  
Binary: 'bi' meaning 2 (1 and 0.)  
Octal 'oct' from 0 to 7 Base is 8.  
Decimal 'Dec' 10 digits from 0 to 9 Base is 10 e.g., (101101)₁₀  
Hexadecimal Hexa 16 digits 0 to 15 or A to F Base is 16 e.g., (1011011)₁₆  

Q9. A) Features of computer.  

(OR)

B) Explain memory units. */5 marks*

Ans: A Computer can store data for future use.

Memory unit is divided into two parts 

In Primary Memory RAM (Random Access Memory) for temporary use. Usefull for retreating data fast as possible however ones the system is shutdown all data in it is wiped clean.

Secondary Storage use for long-term storage. ROM (Read only Memory) e.g., hard disks. It is slow compared to RAM. The all stored data for future time use unless there is some physical damage or the data inside corrupted.

Data representation:  
- Bit 0 or 1.  
- Byte 8 bits  
- Kilobyte 1024 bytes  
- Megabytes 1024 kilobytes.  
- Gigabyte  1024 megabytes  
Terabyte 1024 gigabytes.
