I/O Techniques
1. Programmed I/O
2. Interrupt-driven 
3. DMA.

I. Programmed I/O
* The CPU executes every instructions for an I/O operation.
* The CPU must continuously Poll or check, the status of a device to see if it is ready to transfer data.

II. Interrupt-driven I/O
- The CPU issues a command & then moves on the other tasks.
- When the I/O device ready to transfer data, it sends an interrupt signal to the CPU.

III. D.M.A
- Refers to ++Direct Memory Access++
- A dedicated DMA Controller handles the transfer of data ++between devices & memory, by passing the CPU entirely for the transfer itself.++
- This is the most efficient method for large data transfers, as it frees up the CPU to focus on other tasks while the data is being moved.

# Q2. Write detail about memory hierarchy? *++5 marks++*
Ans: In the Computer System Design, Memory Hierarchy is an enhancement to organize the memory such that it can minimize the access time. The Memory Hierarchy was developed based on a program behavior known as locality of references (same data or nearby data is likely to be accessed again and again). The figure below clearly demonstrates the different
levels of the memory hierarchy.

This Memory Hierarchy Design is divided into 2 main types:
- External Memory or Secondary Memory: Comprising of Magnetic Disk, Optical Disk, and Magnetic Tape i.e. peripheral storage devices which are accessible by the processor via an I/O Module.
- Internal Memory or Primary Memory: Comprising of Main Memory, Cache Memory & CPU registers. This is directly accessible by the processor.

# Q3. What are storage types & input/output devices? *++10 marks++*
Ans(pt.1): Storage devices
- RAM: It stands for Random Access Memory. It is used to store information that is used immediately or we can say that it is a temporary memory. Computers bring the software installed on a hard disk to RAM to process it and to be used by the user. Once, the computer is turned off, the data is deleted. With the help of RAM, computers can perform multiple tasks like loading applications, browsing the web, editing a spreadsheet, experiencing the newest game, etc. It allows you to modify quickly among these tasks, remembering where you're in one task once you switch to a different task. It is also used to load and run applications, like your spreadsheet program, answers commands, like all edits you made within the spreadsheet, or toggle between multiple programs, like once you left the spreadsheet to see the email. Memory is nearly always actively employed by your computer. It ranges from 1GB - 32GB/64GB depending upon the specifications. There are different types of RAM, and although they all serve the same purpose, the most common ones are:
- SRAM: It stands for Static Random Access Memory. It consists of circuits that retain stored information as long as the power supply is on. It is also known as volatile memory. It is used to build Cache memory. The access time of SRAM is lower and it is much faster as compared to DRAM but in terms of cost, it is costly as compared to DRAM.
- DRAM: It stands for Dynamic Random Access Memory. It is used to store binary bits in the form of electrical charges that are applied to capacitors. The access time of DRAM is slower as compared to SRAM but it is cheaper than SRAM and has a high packaging density.
- SDRAM: It stands for Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory. It is faster than DRAM. It is widely used in computers and others. After SDRAM was introduced, the upgraded version of double data rate RAM, i.e., DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4 was entered into the market and widely used in home/office desktops and laptops.
- ROM: It stands for Read-Only Memory. The data written or stored in these devices are non-volatile, i.e, once the data is stored in the memory cannot be modified or deleted. The memory from which will only read but cannot write it. This type of memory is non-volatile. The information is stored permanently during manufacture only once. ROM stores instructions that are used to start a computer. This operation is referred to as bootstrap. It is also used in other electronic items like washers and microwaves. ROM chips can only store a few megabytes (MB) of data, which ranges between 4 and 8 MB per ROM chip. There are two types of ROM: 
- PROM: PROM is Programmable Read-Only Memory. These are ROMs that can be programmed. A special PROM programmer is employed to enter the program on the PROM. Once the chip has been programmed, information on the PROM can't be altered. PROM is non-volatile, that is data is not lost when power is switched off.
- EPROM: Another sort of memory is the Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory. It is possible to erase the info which has been previously stored on an EPROM and write new data onto the chip.
- EEPROM: EEPROM is Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory. Here, data can be erased without using ultraviolet light, with the use of just applying the electric field.
- Floppy Disk: Floppy Disk is also known as a floppy diskette. It is generally used on a personal computer to store data externally. A Floppy disk is made up of a plastic cartridge and secured with a protective case. Nowadays floppy disk is replaced by new and effective storage devices like USB, etc.
- Hard Disk: Hard Disk is a storage device (HDD) that stores and retrieves data using magnetic storage. It is a non-volatile storage device that can be modified or deleted n number of times without any problem. Most computers and laptops have HDDs as their secondary storage device. It is actually a set of stacked disks, just like phonograph records. In every hard disk, the data is recorded electromagnetically in concentric circles or we can say track present on the hard disk, and with the help of a head just like a phonograph arm(but fixed in a position) to read the information present on the track. The read-write speed of HDDs is not so fast but decent. It ranges from a few GBs to a few and more TB.
- Flash Memory Devices It is a cheaper and more portable storage device. It is the most commonly used device to store data because is more reliable and efficient as compared to other storage devices. Some of the commonly used flash memory devices are:
- Pen Drive: It is also known as a USB flash drive that includes flash memory with an integrated USB interface. We can directly connect these devices to our computers and laptops and read/write data into them in a much faster and more efficient way. These devices are very portable. It ranges from 1GB to 256GB generally.
- SSD: It stands for Solid State Drive, a mass storage device like HDD. It is more durable because it does not contain optical disks inside like hard disks. It needs less power as compared to hard disks, is lightweight, and has 10x faster read and writes speed as compared to hard disks. But, these are costly as well. While SSDs serve an equivalent function as hard drives, their internal components are much different. Unlike hard drives, SSDs don't have any moving parts and thus they're called solid-state drives. Instead of storing data on magnetic platters, SSDs store data using non-volatile storage. Since SSDs haven't any moving parts, they do not need to "spin up". It ranges from 150GB to a few more TB.
- SD Card: It is known as a Secure Digital Card. It is generally used with electronic devices like phones, digital cameras, etc. to store larger data. It is portable and the size of the SD card is also small so that it can easily fit into electronic devices. It is available in different sizes like 2GB, 4GB, 8GB, etc.
> [!note]
> SD Cards are able to store TB of data.  
- Memory Card: It is generally used in digital cameras. printers, game consoles, etc. It is also used to store large amounts of data and is available in different sizes. To run a memory card on a computer you require a separate memory card reader.  
Multimedia Card: It is also known as MMC. It is an integrated circuit that is generally used in-car radios, digital cameras, etc. It is an external device to store data/information.

Ans (pt.2): Input devices are the devices that are used to send signals to the computer for performing tasks. The receiver at the end is the CPU (Central Processing Unit), which works to send signals to the output devices. Some of the classifications of Input devices are:
1. Keyboard is the most frequent and widely used input device for entering data into a computer. Although there are some additional keys for performing other operations, the keyboard layout is similar to that of a typical typewriter. Generally, keyboards come in two sizes: 84 keys or 101/102 keys but currently keyboards with 104 keys or 108 keys are also available for Windows and the Internet.
2. Mouse is a common pointing device is the mouse. The mouse is used to move a little cursor across the screen while clicking and dragging. The cursor will stop if you let go of the mouse. The computer is dependent on you to move the mouse; it won't move by itself. As a result, it's an input device.
A mouse is an input device that lets you move the mouse on a flat surface to control the coordinates and movement of the on-screen cursor/pointer.
The left mouse button can be used to select or move items, while the right mouse button when clicked displays extra menus.
3. Scanner is an input device that functions similarly to a photocopier. It's employed when there's information on paper that needs to be transferred to the computer's hard disc for subsequent manipulation. The scanner collects images from the source and converts them to a digital format that may be saved on a disc. Before they are printed, these images can be modified. 
4. Microphone works as an input device that receives input voice signals and also has the responsibility of converting it also to digital form. It is a very common device that is present in every device which is related to music.

Output Devices are the devices that show us the result after giving the input to a computer system. Output can be of many different forms like image, graphic audio, video, etc. Some of the output devices are described below.
1. Monitors, also known as Visual Display Units (VDUs), are a computer's primary output device. It creates images by arranging small dots, known as pixels, in a rectangular pattern. The amount of pixels determines the image's sharpness. 
The two kinds of viewing screens used for monitors are described below:
- Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) Monitor: Pixels are minuscule visual elements that make up a CRT display. The higher the image quality or resolution, the smaller the pixels.
- Flat-Panel Display Monitor: In comparison to the CRT, a flat-panel display is a type of video display with less volume, weight, and power consumption. They can be hung on the wall or worn on the wrist. Flat-panel displays are currently used in calculators, video games, monitors, laptop computers, and graphical displays.
2. Printers are output devices that allow you to print information on paper. There are certain types of printers which are described below.
3. Speakers are devices that produce sound after getting a command from a computer. Nowadays, speakers come with wireless technology also like Bluetooth.
4. Projectors are optical devices that have the work to show visuals on both types of screens, stationary and moving both. It helps in displaying images on a big screen. Projectors are generally used in theatres, auditoriums, etc.
5. Plotter is a device that helps in making graphics or other images to give a real view. A graphic card is mandatorily required to use these devices. These are the pen-like devices that help in generating exact designs on the computer.
6. Braille Reader is a very important device that is used by blind users. It helps people with low vision or no vision to recognize the data by running their fingers over the device to understand easily. It is a very important device for blind persons as it gives them the comfort to understand the letters, alphabets, etc which helps them in study.
7. A video Card is a device that is fitted into the motherboard of the computer. It helps in improvising digital content in output devices. It is an important tool that helps people in using multiple devices.
