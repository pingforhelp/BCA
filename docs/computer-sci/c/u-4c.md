- Pointer arithmetic, Pointers and arrays. Function Prototype, definition and calling. - Return statement. Nesting of functions.
- Categories of functions. Recursion (Basic Concept only).
- Parameter Passing by address & by value. Local and Global variables. -
- Storage classes: automatic, external, static and register.


A pointer is a valuable that stores the address of another valuable. Instead of storing the dircaily it stores the value localed in memory. 

``` c
pointer;
```
Here:
- X stores val of 10
- P stores the address of X. 

# Pointer declaration
it specifies the type of data the pointer will point to. 

syntax:
``` c
int some = 67;
```


# Accessing values using pointers
