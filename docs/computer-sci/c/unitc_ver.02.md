# **Purpose of C**

Dennis Ritchie developed **C** to make *system software* (like operating systems).

**UNIX** is one of the first operating systems written in **C**, which made it portable and efficient.

# Features of C

C became popular because it:
1. Combined the efficiency of assembly language with the simplicity of a high-level language.
2. Allowed writing programs that can run on different computers portable.
3. Became a foundation for many modern languages, such as C++, Java, and Python.

2. **Portable** C programs can run on different computers without change
3. **Structured Languages** A program can be divided into functions/blocks.
4. **Rich Library** C has many built-in functions like `printf()` and `scanf()`.
5. **Middle-Level Language** Supports both low-level and high-level programming.
6. **Modular** Large programs can be broken into smaller functions.



# sC Tokens
Tokens are the smallest building blocks of a C program.
They are like words in a language.

# Types of Tokens
1. Keywords
2. Identifiers
3. Constants
4. Operators
5. Special Symbols (, ; () etc...).
6. Strings

# Keywords
* Keywords are reserved words with a special meaning.
* **Rules:**
1. You **cannot** use them as variable names.
2. They tell the compiler what to do.
**Examples:** `int`, `float`, `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `return`, `char`, `const`.

# **Identifiers**
Identifiers are **names given by the programmer** to:
* variables
* functions
* arrays
* etc.

**Purpose:**
They help us identify data in the program.

# Constants
Constants are values that doses *not* change during a program’s execution.

# Types of Constants
| Type               | Example                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Integer Const**  | 10, -5, 2, 3, etc.           |
| **Floating Const** | 5.55, 7.25, 3.00, 9.24, etc. |
| **Char Const**     | 'A', 'B', 'C', etc.          |
| **String Const**   | "My Name"                    |

# Operators in C
An **operator** is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform a specific operation such as **addition, subtraction, comparison, assignment**, etc.

# Types of Operators in C

# **Variables in C**
A variable is a **named memory location** used to store data that can change.

**Why Variables Are Needed?** Variables store data during program execution.
A variable is a **container that stores a value**.

**Variables are needed to:**
* Store input data
* Perform calculations
* Store program results
* Make code readable and reusable

# Variable Declaration
Tells the compiler **what type of data** the variable will store.

Example:
```c
int a;
float b;
char c;
```
# Variable Initialization
Assigning a value to a variable.

Example:
```c
a = 10;
b = 10.5;
c = 'M';
stockerid = "SSzxxc1";
```

# **Rules for Naming Variables**

### ✅ 1. Must start with a **letter (a–z or A–Z)** or **underscore (_)**

* `1a = 10;` → ❌ Invalid
* `A = 10;` → ✔️ Valid
* `_a = 10;` → ✔️ Valid
* `a = 10;` → ✔️ Valid

Examples of valid identifiers:

```c
int age;
int _height;
```

---

### ✅ 2. Can contain only:

* letters
* digits
* underscores `_`

#### Examples:

| Valid              | Invalid           |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| `int total_marks;` | `int total-mark;` |
| `int sum1;`        | `int price#;`     |

---

### ✅ 3. No spaces allowed

| Valid              | Invalid            |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `int total_marks;` | `int total marks;` |

---

### ✅ 4. Cannot use keywords

(Examples: `int`, `float`, `if`, `else` cannot be used as variable names)

# **More Rules for Naming Variables**

## **1. Case Sensitive**

C is a **case-sensitive language**, meaning uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as **different variables**.

Example:

```c
int age = 10;
Age = 25;
printf("%d", age);   // Output: 10
```

Here, `age` and `Age` are different.

---

## **2. No Special Characters Allowed (Except Underscore _)**

You **cannot** use characters like:

* `@`
* `%`
* `-`
* `#`
* `$`

### Examples:

| Valid         | Invalid       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `total_marks` | `total-marks` |
| `sum1`        | `sum@`        |

# **Length of Variable Name**

There is **no strict limit**, but most compilers recognize only the **first 31 characters**.

---

# **Meaningful and Readable Names**

Use meaningful names.

❌ Avoid:

```c
int a, b, c;   // Meaningless
```

---

# **Data Types**

Data types define:

* what kind of data a variable can store
* how much memory it occupies

---

# **1) Primitive Data Types**

| Data Type  | Size (bytes) | Format Specifier | Example            |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| **int**    | 2 or 4       | `%d`             | `int a = 10;`      |
| **float**  | 4            | `%f`             | `float b = 10.5;`  |
| **double** | 8            | `%lf`            | `double d = 8.54;` |
| **char**   | 1            | `%c`             | `char c = 'M';`    |

* It is written as **comments**, and the compiler **ignores it**.

---

# **Preprocessor Section**

* This section includes header files using the **#include statement**.
* Header files contain predefined functions like `printf()` and `scanf()`.

---

## **Syntax**

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // stdio → standard input/output
#include <math.h>    // math.h → mathematical functions
```

# **Definition Section**

* Used to define **constants** or **macros** before the main program.
* `#define` keyword is used for constant definitions.

### Example:

```c
#define PI 3.14
```

**Note:** Whenever the compiler finds `PI`, it replaces it with `3.14`.

---

# **Global Declaration Section**

* Variables or functions declared here can be **used anywhere in the program**.
* They are defined **outside the main()** function.

### Example:

```c
int num = 10;
```

---

# **main() Function Section**

* This is the **starting point** of every C program.
* The compiler starts execution from the **main()** function.

# **main() Function (continued)**

* The main function can return a value (usually **int**).

### **Syntax**

```c
int main()
{
    // variable declaration
    // logic / process
    
    return 0;
}
```

### **Note:**

Everything that happens in a C program runs inside the `{ }` of the **main()** function.

---

# **Subprograms (User-Defined Functions)**

* These are functions created by the **programmer** to perform specific tasks.
* They make programs **modular** and **easier to reuse**.

In C, **input and output** are done using certain functions.
There are **2 types**:

1. **Formatted I/O**
2. **Unformatted I/O**

---

# **Formatted I/O**

These allow formatted input and output using **format specifiers**.

## **1) printf() → Output**

### Syntax:

```c
printf("%d", a);
```
