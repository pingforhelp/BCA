# Where the mind is without fear *by Rabindranath Tagore*

# Poem
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;  
Where knowledge is free;  
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;  
Where words come out from the depth of truth;  
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;  
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;  
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action;  
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

# Q&A

# Q1. What does Tagore mean by “the mind is without fear and the head is held high”? Do you think freedom from fear is essential for progress? Why or why not?
**Ans**: Rabindranath Tagore’s line “the mind is without fear and the head is held high” conveys his vision of an ideal nation. Meaning. “The mind is without fear” — People should live without fear, oppression, discrimination, ignorance, or restrictions. “The head is held high” — Symbolizes dignity, self-respect, and equality. Every individual should feel valued, not bowed down by poverty, inequality, or suppression. Is freedom from fear essential for progress?
Yes. Freedom from fear is essential for genuine progress because: It encourages creativity and innovation — people dare to think differently. It promotes equality — a fearless society ensures that everyone, regardless of background, can speak up and participate. It strengthens democracy — citizens can question authority and demand justice without fear. It builds confidence — individuals with dignity can work towards personal and national growth. Without freedom from fear, progress may be only material or outward, but not true progress of the mind and spirit.
