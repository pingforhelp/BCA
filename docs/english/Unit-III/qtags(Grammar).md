# Question Tags
A question tag is a small question attached to a statement. It is used to know the opinion of the person with whom you are conversing. The question tag may be positive or negative.

The form of the question tag:
* **Positive** - Auxiliary Verb + not + Pronoun?
* **Negative** - Auxiliary Verb + Pronoun?

Negative Tags are added to Positive Statements:
1) He is a good boy. 
   Isn't he?
2) He is not good boy; is he?
3) I am a student; aren't I?
4) I am not a student; am I?
5) He has posted the letter; hasn't he?
6) You are beautiful; aren't you?
7) You will work here; won't you?

Positive Tags are added to Negative Statements:
1) He is not a Singer, is he?
2) Rama was not killed Ravana, was he?
3) They are not playing, are they?
4) You can't fool me, can you?

> [!NOTE]
> If 'am' is used in the positive statements 'aren't I' used in the tag.
> [!example] 
> I am a doctor, aren't I?
> When 'am' is used in the negative statement, the tag is 'am I'.

> [!example] 
> I am not a doctor, am I?
> The appropriate form of "do" is used according to the subject and tense of the statement.

> [!example] 
> He became an engineer, didn't he?

[do is helping - hiding verb]

> [!example] 
> Coffee tastes bitter, doesn't it?

> [!example] 
> They come here everyday, don't they?

With Imperatives expressing an order or request.. will, would, can, could are used in the tag.
> [!example] 
> 1. Help me with this bag, could you?
> 2. Close the door, will you?
> 3. Don't make any noise, will you?

After 'let', we use 'shall we' to make suggestions.
> [!example] 
> Let's go for a walk, shall we?

We use 'they' in question tags when the subject is somebody / someone / everybody / everyone / nobody / noone.

> [!example] 
> 1. No one phoned for me, did they?
> 2. Everybody enjoyed the event, did they?

We use 'it' in question tags after 'nothing', 'everything', & 'something'.

> [!example] 
> 1. Nothing is new, is it?
> 2. She has been to London, are you?
> 3. None of them were happy there, ( ) h) hasn't she?
> 4. Open the window, ( ) i) isn't she?
> 5. We are Indians, ( ) j) will you?
