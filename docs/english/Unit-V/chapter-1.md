# Q&A
# Q1. According to the narrator, how does the astrologer help attract customers? How does the astrologer help customers and satisfy their needs?
Ans: The astrologer’s appearance is carefully designed to create an impression of wisdom and mysticism. He has a dark face with bright eyes that seem to shine with an “abnormal gleam,” giving him an air of hidden knowledge. He decorates his forehead with sacred ash and vermilion and wears a turban that enhances his authority.

His calculated gestures, long pauses, and mysterious behaviour make people believe he can truly read their past and future. In reality, the astrologer relies not on astrology but on his sharp powers of observation and understanding of human psychology. Customers usually come with common worries about money, love, health, or enemies, and he cleverly tells them what they want to hear. By giving reassurance, hope, and practical advice, he satisfies their emotional needs even if his predictions are not scientific. His words offer comfort and confidence, which is often more valuable than the truth.

# Q2. Describe the astrologer’s life and the life he never expected to live.
Answer: The astrologer lives in a busy marketplace, earning his living by pretending to tell people’s fortunes. Every evening, under the dim lights of vendors’ flares, he sets up his little space. His life is a constant struggle for survival, and he depends on his ability to attract customers with his appearance and clever talk, charging only a few coins for his predictions.

However, this life is not what he once expected. As a young man, he lived in a village and never dreamed of becoming an astrologer. He once stabbed a man during a quarrel and believed he had killed him. Out of guilt and fear of punishment, he abandoned his family and ambitions and fled to the city. His present life as an astrologer is therefore a result of necessity, not choice. He survives by playing the role of a wise man, constantly hiding his past.


### 3. What qualities in the astrologer helped him escape the danger he was about to encounter?
Ans:  The astrologer’s survival depends on his intelligence, presence of mind, and ability to read people’s thoughts. When he meets Guru Nayak—the very man he once thought he had killed—the situation becomes extremely dangerous. Guru Nayak insists on knowing the truth about his enemy and threatens the astrologer. However, the astrologer cleverly turns the situation to his advantage. He listens carefully, asks leading questions, and gradually gains control of the conversation. By pretending to use his mystical powers, he reveals accurate details about Guru Nayak’s life and then tells him that his enemy is already dead. He advises him to return home immediately.

This removes the threat, as Guru Nayak abandons his plan for revenge. The astrologer’s psychological insight, quick thinking, and clever use of words save him from danger.


# Q4. Describe the astrologer’s appearance and attitude.
Ans: The astrologer is the protagonist of the story. The opening of the story describes his typical outfit and appearance while performing his profession. He dresses like a traditional astrologer, with sacred ash and vermilion on his bright forehead and a saffron-coloured turban around his head.

His appearance suits his character and makes him a centre of attraction. People are easily fooled by his confident manner and sharp wit. He is intelligent and has a strong understanding of human nature. Though he has no real mystical knowledge, he knows how to put on a convincing show.

The astrologer lives by his wits in a crowded urban environment. He works long hours to earn enough to support himself and his family. He is courageous and determined—especially when dealing with Guru Nayak—and remains calm even when his life is in danger. He is a devoted husband and father who brings home every single earning so that his wife can buy food for the family.

# Q5. How does the narrator build suspense in the story?
Ans: The short story *An Astrologer’s Day* by R. K. Narayan is a suspenseful tale that deals with a single day in the life of an ordinary astrologer. It begins like any normal day but gradually builds tension as unexpected events unfold. Suspense is created when Guru Nayak appears near the end of the day. As readers, we are shocked to learn that the astrologer and Guru Nayak share a violent past. The revelation that the astrologer once tried to kill him adds to the tension. The confrontation between the two men, combined with the fear of exposure and revenge, keeps readers engaged until the story ends with a clever twist.

clients through his street-smart ways and sweet talk. However, despite being revealed as a near-murderer, it is difficult to judge him as a negative character.

He is forced to make a living in a new city after fleeing his village out of fear. With no other skills, he adopts astrology as a livelihood under distress. He tricks Guru Nayak into believing that his attacker had already died, not out of cruelty but to protect his own life and identity. He also has a wife and child to support, which makes his actions understandable. Thus, the story evokes sympathy for the astrologer.

## Retold – *An Astrologer’s Day* from Guru Nayak’s Point of View

Guru Nayak is the man whom the astrologer once tried to murder several years before the story takes place. He leaves his village and travels in search of the man who attacked him, determined to take revenge.

When he meets the astrologer, he does not recognize him due to the disguise of paint, turban, and beard. Initially skeptical, Guru Nayak becomes convinced when the astrologer reveals accurate details about his past and even mentions his name. Believing the astrologer to be a prophet, Guru Nayak accepts his advice and abandons his quest for revenge.
