# Refund *By Fritz Karinthy*

# About the Author
Fritz Karinthy is a well-known short story writer who wrote the one-act play **Refund** in the year 1938. This is the story of a former student who studied in the school. Fritz Karinthy (1887–1938) is the most popular Hungarian playwright, poet, novelist, journalist, and translator. He published in 1912 *That’s How You Write*, a little parody that brought him instant fame. The play **Refund** is full of humour which deals with an extraordinary absurd situation.

# Q1. Sketch the character of Wasserkopf (You can take the adjectives from the lesson and use them.)
Ans: Wasserkopf is the central character in Fritz Karinthy’s play *Refund*. He is portrayed as a rude, arrogant, and unemployed man who blames his failures on his education. He is lazy and irresponsible. Toward the teachers he behaves in a way meant to provoke them and at the same time he is foolish because he underestimates the cleverness of his masters. Though he comes with confidence to demand a “refund”, his lack of intelligence works against him. Finally, his selfishness and arrogance make him look ridiculous, and he is defeated by the very teachers he tries to humiliate. Thus, Wasserkopf is drawn as a narrow-minded and self-destructive man.

# Q2. How did the Mathematics Master manage to trick Wasserkopf into a self-defeating situation?
Ans: The Mathematics Master asked Wasserkopf to calculate the total amount of his tuition fees. Wasserkopf quickly gave the correct figure since he had come prepared with it to demand a “refund”. The master cleverly declared that since Wasserkopf had answered correctly, he deserved to pass in Mathematics. This trick put Wasserkopf in a self-defeating situation. If he insisted that his answer was wrong, he would lose his claim for a refund because his calculation of the fees would also be wrong. But if he accepted it as correct, then he had to admit that he passed in Mathematics. In this way, the Mathematics Master’s clever trick trapped Wasserkopf in his own argument.

# Q3. How did the masters frame their questions? How did Wasserkopf plan his answers?
Ans: The masters framed their questions in such a way that even the silliest answers given by Wasserkopf could be twisted into correct ones. They asked him simple or open-ended questions in different subjects like Mathematics, Physics, Geography, and History. Their plan was right. Wasserkopf, on the other hand, planned to behave rudely and give absurd answers. He wanted to show that his education was worthless and that he had learned nothing by insulting the teachers and making fun of their subjects. He hoped to fail the exam, but the masters were much smarter than him and turned all his foolish replies into proof of his brilliance.

# Q4. How did the Principal manage the situation?
Ans: The Principal handled the situation with calmness and intelligence. At first, he was shocked by Wasserkopf’s demand for a refund, but then he agreed to hold an examination. He supported the teachers in their plan to trap Wasserkopf in every subject. Finally, he announced that Wasserkopf had passed with distinction, calling him one of the best students. By doing this, the Principal protected the school’s reputation and avoided paying back the fees. His cleverness turned Wasserkopf’s demand into a defeat for him. The Principal’s management shows authority, wisdom, and presence of mind.

# Q5. How does the play ridicule both the education system and Wasserkopf’s greed?
Ans: The play *Refund* uses humour and satire to criticise both the education system and Wasserkopf’s greed. On one hand, Wasserkopf, who wasted his education, blames his failures on his teachers and foolishly demands his fees back. His greed and arrogance make him look ridiculous, especially when he falls into the teachers’ trap.

On the other hand, the teachers also come under criticism because instead of proving their real knowledge, they twist Wasserkopf’s silly answers into correct ones just to protect their school’s reputation. This shows how the education system sometimes focuses more on saving face than on genuine learning. The exaggerated situations in the play expose the flaws on both sides. The audience laughs at Wasserkopf’s foolishness but also notices the teachers’ dishonesty. Thus, the play ridicules both the greedy student and the weak education system that avoids responsibility.

# Q6. How are the teachers presented in the play?
Ans: The teachers in the play appear more interested in defending their own reputation than in showing true wisdom. When Wasserkopf demands a “refund”, they feel insulted and quickly try to stop him from winning instead of testing his real knowledge. They frame their questions in such a way that even his nonsense answers can be called correct. This is not genuine teaching but clever manipulation. Their main goal is to protect the honour of the school and avoid returning the fees.  
However, their intelligence and quick thinking cannot be denied because they manage to outsmart Wasserkopf at every step. They show sharpness and presence of mind, but these qualities are used for self-defence rather than true education. In this way, the play presents the teachers as clever but not completely honest.

# Q7. How does Wasserkopf’s greed blind him to the tricks of the teachers?
Ans: Wasserkopf comes to the school with only one aim—to get his fees refunded. His greed makes him rude, careless, and overconfident. He insults his former teachers and deliberately gives absurd answers, thinking this will prove that his education was worthless. He does not realise that the teachers are smarter and are cleverly twisting his replies into correct ones.  
When the Mathematics Master asks him to calculate his fees, Wasserkopf proudly gives the right answer, not noticing that he has just passed the subject. His mind is so fixed on getting the refund that he cannot see he is being tricked, even when the teachers tolerate his behaviour, which should have made him suspicious. In the end, his greed blinds him completely, and he loses the game.

## 8) What does the play suggest about the meaning and value of education?

**Answer:**  
The play suggests that education should not be judged only by success or failure in life. Wasserkopf believes his education is useless because he did not get a job, but this is a narrow view. Education is about learning values, discipline, and the ability to think, not just about earning money.  
At the same time, the play shows that teachers and schools also have a responsibility. Instead of focusing only on their reputation, they should ensure that real learning takes place. Through humour and satire, the play makes us question whether the education system truly prepares students for life. It also warns us against blaming education alone for personal failures.
