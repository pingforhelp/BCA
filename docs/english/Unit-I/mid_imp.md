Q2. 
Ans:
The things described as *sweet*:
- The shade of the coconut glade.  
- The silent of the mango grove.  
- The sands at the full moon, with the sound of the voices we love.

However, the poem then contrasts these with what is considered *sweeter*.  
The following are considered the *sweetest*:

- The kiss of the spray (“The feel of the wild foam on their faces”).  
- The dance of the wild foam on the sand.  
- The movement of the wild foam on the shore.

This contrast highlights the fishermen’s preference for the exciting and adventurous life over the comfortable pleasures of life.
