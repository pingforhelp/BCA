# Q1. What kind of place was Deoli Station, and why did the narrator find it lonely?
Ans: Deoli Station is described as a small, remote, and quiet railway station surrounded by hills and forests. It is not a busy place but rather isolated and peaceful. The narrator found Deoli Station lonely because it was far from urban areas, and there were very few people around. The station was often empty, and the stillness of the place gave a sense of solitude. The sparse human presence and the natural surroundings added to the feeling of loneliness that the narrator experienced while waiting.

# Q4. How did the girl react when she saw the narrator again during his return journey?
Ans: When the girl saw the narrator again during his return journey, she looked at him with a mixture of surprise and embarrassment. She seemed even more shy and startled upon seeing him and avoided direct eye contact.

# Q9. Why did the narrator never break his journey at Deoli, though he wished to meet the girl?
Ans: Although the narrator wished to stop at Deoli, he feared destroying the idealized image he had created. The uncertainty and the possibility of reality not matching his dream held him back.

**(i) Tenderness or Affection:**

**(iii) Sadness and Regret:**
There was sorrow in his heart because he never met her again and missed the chance to express his feelings. He regretted not acting on impulse to know her better.

**(iv) Nostalgia:**
Over the years, the memory of the girl became a symbol of lost youth and innocent love. Thinking of her brought back emotions of that time—pure, simple, and unforgettable.
