# Q1. What kind of place was Deoli Station, and why did the narrator find it lonely?
Ans: Deoli Station is described as a small, remote, and quiet railway station surrounded by hills and forests. It is not a busy place but rather isolated and peaceful. The narrator found Deoli Station lonely because it was far from urban areas, and there were very few people around. The station was often empty, and the stillness of the place gave a sense of solitude. The sparse human presence and the natural surroundings added to the feeling of loneliness that the narrator experienced while waiting.
